\section{INTRODUCTION} 
The scope of this document is to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Clarify all points} not properly explained in the proposal paper
    \item Summarize all \textbf{work done}
    \item Define the \textbf{missing work} 
    \item Estimate \textbf{time to finish the project}.
\end{itemize}

\section{CLARIFICATION POINTS}
One of the most important points of clarification concern the data: in the proposal paper, we did not provide an extensive explanation of how data are built and how we want to use them.
The graphs chosen in SNAP$^\text{\cite{SNAP}}$ are undirected and contain communities, no other features are present in the files. 
We want to use all communities as label, and a node can only belong to one community.
For GAT tuning we want to compute the following feature for each node:
\begin{itemize}
    \item betweenness centrality
    \item closeness centrality
    \item clustering coefficient
    \item \textit{(other possible features)}
\end{itemize}


\section{WORK DONE}
We have already built the \textbf{precomputation module} (explained in the project proposal) 
and the code to automate the testing phase inside cluster.

\section{WORK IN PROGRESS}
We nedd to build the \textbf{GAT module} and do the tests on \textbf{CAPRI}$^\text{\cite{CAPRI}}$. 
We must also decide the hyperparameters in node2vec.

\section{ESTIMATION}
In our estimation, we can finish the paper five or six days before the deadline.

% WHAT MIGHT BE ADDED IN THE NEXT UPDATE PROPOSAL 
% --> list of analytical test to be conducted 
% --> in case the fact that the GAT cannot compute directed graphs
% --> more local graph features that came up to our mind
% --> everything that will be modified (DAHHH)
